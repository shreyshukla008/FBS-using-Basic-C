 INTRODUCTION
 
Our software is designed to help users find and compare flights based on 
their desired destination and budget. It is built using the objective C 
programming language, which allows us to create a fast and efficient 
program. When a user inputs their date of travelling, the software displays 
a list of available flights with corresponding prices, allowing them to easily 
compare options and choose the best option for their needs. 
 
One key benefit of our software is that it is very light and runs smoothly, 
even on systems with limited resources. This is in contrast to many other 
flight booking systems, which can be quite resource-intensive and can 
negatively impact a user's system performance. By offering a lightweight 
solution, we are able to provide a convenient and hassle-free experience for 
users. 
 
We believe that our software will be appealing to a wide audience, as it 
offers a simple and efficient way to book flights without compromising 
system performance. We are confident that this software will be a valuable 
resource for anyone looking for an easy way to book flights.
